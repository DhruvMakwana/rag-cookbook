"""
Documentation-only companion to post_retrieval.py.

Not run top-to-bottom, not imported by anything. Every function below is
self-contained — its own imports, its own inlined helpers — so
copy-pasting any single function into a fresh .py works on its own. See
post_retrieval.py for the actual runnable CLI, and any other recipe
folder for why this two-file split exists.

Functions that call an LLM use `llm.generate(prompt, provider=provider)`
— llm.py is the same pluggable Anthropic/OpenAI/Ollama wrapper used
across this whole repo (see llm.py in this folder). `provider=None`
uses whatever LLM_PROVIDER is set to in your .env. cross_encoder_rerank
needs no LLM key at all — it's fully local.

If you change something in post_retrieval.py, mirror it here too —
these are NOT kept in sync automatically.
